# News Site

Created a responsive news site with flexbox and grid to practice the basics of HTML and CSS.

## The problem

My biggest issue was understanding grid and flex-box. I started building the webpage before even going through enough tutorials, I was too eager to get going. This resulted in me facing lots of issues I had no clue how to solve.
So, after I structured myself a little bit and understood it might be a good idea to get into some video tutorials first, then everything just kinda got in order.  

Another issue I had was that I got too much into the design part and that took lots of time from me.

When solving the problems that occured along the way I mainly used w3schools.com and video tutorials. 

Next time I will try to use Stack Owerflow more.

If I had more time I would use it to make the "other news"-grid better looking and also it would be fun to try out some JavaScript for "Read more"-buttons and so on.
